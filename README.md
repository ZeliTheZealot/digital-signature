# digital-signature

A crate consisting of benches and tests of the Rust implementations of `libsecp256k1-rs`, `threshold_crypto`, and `multi-party-ecdsa`. 

Note: currently, the `libsecp256k1-rs` tests don't work. (The bench works)

Currently working on making Structs and functions to wrap `libsecp256k1-rs`.
